# Recreating C Library - string.h and ctype.h
This is the first project in the curriculum provided by software engineering school - 42.

This project recreates functions from string.h and ctype.h libraries. Apart from creating functions from these libraries, the
project also creates some new functions.

Except for linked list functions, test cases are provided at the bottom for all the remaining functions which are commented.

# Compiling a program.

Compiling can be tricky. There are severeal methods to compile. For instance, in order to compile ft_strsplit.c program, following command can be ran:
> gcc ft_strsplit.c ft_endtrim.c ft_strsub.c ft_wordcount.c ft_strlen.c

This gives an a.out file, which can be executed by simply typing./a.out

Below are the snapshots of these functions.

To assess how the functions performed, these functions were tested using the following repo: https://github.com/alelievr/libft-unit-test
